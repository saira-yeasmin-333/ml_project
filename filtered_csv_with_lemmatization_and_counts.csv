218,5,"This is a special book. It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. 
 It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I've read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being ""reactionaries"", etc. 
 It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. 
 But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. 
 I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they've gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don't get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. 
 I loved this quote: 
 ""In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....""",96,1,0.9900000000000002,True,2086,0.5921819806098938,"This is a special book .

218,5,"I decided to give up eating processed sugar for the month of January, and so reading a book with this title seemed like it would help me adhere. And not only did it succeed in that goal, but I think it put a permanent, deep scare in me about sugar. The book basically argues that sugar is the root cause of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even a lot of cancer. 
 What is interesting is while all of us know that sugar is not good for us, the only thing that people officially blame on overconsumption of it is tooth decay. Obesity is highly correlated with diabetes, heart disease, and a number of other bad things. If you Google for the cause of obesity, you see statements like ""Obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little. If you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don't burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat."" This book makes the argument that a calorie is not a calorie, that sugar is actually toxic, but unlike other toxins it takes decades of overconsumption to show up - which has made it hard to prove. 
 The statistics are fascinating. Fifty years ago, one in eight American adults was obese; today the number is greater than one in three. Diabetes has gone from 1 in 2,000-3,000 to 1 in 7-8, which is an astounding increase. The book listed numerous examples of native populations that suffered from a similar diabetes epidemic after adopting the ""western diets and lifestyle"". What is it about western lifestyle that has done this? The culprit is almost certainly something in the diet, and linked to processed foods - and after reading this book, it seems very logical that sugar is either the root or one of the main root causes. 
 ""By the late 1970s, though, sugar had mostly vanished from the discussion. Dietary fat had been implicated as a cause of heart disease. Nutritionists and public-health authorities responded by rejecting the idea that sugar could be responsible for the diseases that associated with heart disease, which included both obesity and diabetes."" 
 The book gives a fascinating history of how nutritionists and the government have viewed sugar as largely harmless. This included an impressive amount of lobbying from the sugar industry to vindicate themselves. Mind-blowingly, the sugar industry back in the 50's actually advertised sugar as a great, healthy way to get calories. Sugar has never, and largely is still not thought of as a root cause of obesity - the narrative is still more about fats and ""lifestyle"" (i.e. lack of exercise). 
 ""To the sugar industry, it has been the gift that keeps on giving, the ultimate defense against all arguments and evidence that sugar is uniquely toxic. This is the idea that we get obese or overweight because we take in more calories than we expend or excrete. By this thinking, researchers and public-health authorities think of obesity as a disorder of ""energy balance,"" a concept that has become so ingrained in conventional thinking, so widespread, that arguments to the contrary have typically been treated as quackery, if not a willful disavowal of the laws of physics."" 
 ""Fat"" is often the culprit named for people getting fat (even the word is the same!), and thus was born a processed food industry that touts ""low-fat"" items (which are then rich in sugar+salt to offset the bad taste). But looking at populations that eat high fat content but low sugar, shows lower rates of obesity and heart disease. For instance, the French. 
 ""When researchers realized that the French had relatively low rates of heart disease despite a diet that was rich in saturated fats, they wrote it off as an inexplicable ""paradox,"" and ignored the fact that the French traditionally consumed far less sugar than did populations-- the Americans and British, most notably-- in which coronary disease seemed to be a scourge. At the end of the eighteenth century, French per capita sugar consumption was less than a fifth of what it was in England. At the end of the nineteenth century, even after the beet-sugar revolution, France was still lagging far behind both the British and the Americans-- thirty-three pounds for the French compared with eighty-eight for the English and sixty-six for Americans."" 
 Interestingly, when we say ""sugar"" we can actually be referring to a number of things: fructose, glucose, or sucrose. Glucose is used to refer to blood sugar levels in blood, and also comes from eating carb rich foods like bread or potatoes. Sucrose is table sugar, which actually made of part fructose. Fructose is the scary one because ""it is very different from other sugars because it has a different metabolic pathway and is not the preferred energy source for muscles or the brain."". Fructose is found in fruit but as such low levels that it isn't harmful, plus its offset by rich fibers. But high fructose corn syrup? Avoid at all costs. 
 The logic is basically: IF excess sugar (fructose notably) leads to insulin resistance, THEN we can say with confidence that it is likely a root cause of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer, as it's been proven to be correlated with all those things. High fat diets - particularly the wrong sorts of fats - are also involved if eaten in excess. The logic seems solid - and yet even searching ""what causes obesity"" you don't see sugar named as a key cause. I'd be very curious to learn from nutritionists what the think of this logic. 
 ""Is it that we're all simply eating too much and exercising too little, which is the one simple answer that the nutritional establishment will embrace in the face of so much evidence to the contrary? Another simple answer, and a more likely one, is sugar.""",299,1,1.1,True,5775,0.5258038640022278,"I decided to give up eating processed sugar for the month of January , and so reading a book with this title seemed like it would help me adhere .

218,4,"Kevin Kelly, who is a Wired co-founder, lays out technological trends that are ""inevitable"". Like too many nonfiction books, I found a few chapters to be worth reading, and a few not to be. I enjoyed the sections on AI and books. And sometimes just zooming out to get bigger perspective is engaging, which was the case for me in the sections on VR/AR and tracking. Much of the rest of the book seemed geared for people less technically savvy, which was my only complaint as it really drew the book out. 
 There is a famous saying in software said by Marc Andreeson that ""software is eating the world"". Kelly predicts, I believe correctly, that the next phase of this will be AI: ""It is hard to imagine anything that would ""change everything"" as much as cheap, powerful, ubiquitous artificial"". Kelly's perspective here that while it might feel like innovation in technology is slowing to some, it is much more likely that we are on the brink of the next renaissance, and we will all be ""taking X and adding AI"", much as happened with electricity and then the internet. 
 Kelly correctly identified the three key trends that are making AI an exciting space today: processing power (GPU's), data, and better algorithms. However he didn't dive more into the longest pole: how to get a lot more data than we have today - that seems to me to be the key. But cool to get an overview. He did address one of the big fears about automation that many people have today: will computers take all our jobs? The quick answer is yes, but we'll have new ones. This has already happened multiple times in history. I agree with this, but think the more interesting question is what will happen when we can provide most people the basics (food, water, shelter) for very little cost. This was predicted in Diamond Age, and the answer was ""parking lots and chaos"", and a lot of people with no purpose in life. 
 I also greatly enjoyed the section on books, mostly because (1) Goodreads is mentioned (hey I have paternal pride), and (2) it talks about things we at Goodreads are working on. Such as, the ability to see other peoples notes: ""Reading becomes social. With screens we can share not just the titles of books we are reading, but our reactions and notes as we read them. Today, we can highlight a passage. Tomorrow, we will be able to link passages."" Well, here are my notes from this book! 
 Another big idea that Kelly hits on that I think is big and inevitable is how each book will become networked, much as the WWW has. Once we have ability to have pointers into and out from each sentence of a book, the speed at which ideas will fly out of books will step function. 
 In the goodness of time, as all books become fully digital, every one of them will accumulate the equivalent of blue underlined passages as each literary reference is networked within that book out to all other books. Each page in a book will discover other pages and other books. Thus books will seep out of their bindings and weave themselves together into one large metabook, the universal library.

218,3,"A fun, fast paced science fiction thriller. I read it in 2 nights and couldn't put it down. The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: 
 ""I think about all the choices we've made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don't know..."" ""What?"" ""So fragile."" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, ""It's terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world."" 
 This book can't be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I'm being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I'd still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. 
 If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. Regret can't be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day. I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. 
 ""Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. But life is imperfect. We make the wrong choices. So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse? I built something that could actually eradicate regret. Let you find worlds where you made the right choice."" Daniela says, ""Life doesn't work that way. You live with your choices and learn.

218,4,"A fascinating book about community and belonging, and how modern society has moved us away from our roots in potentially signifiant ways. The book opens with a thought provoking fact: in early America, there were numerous instances of white people joining primitive, native Indian societies - but zero instances of the opposite, because ""the intensely communal nature of an Indian tribe held an appeal that the material benefits of Western civilization couldn't necessarily compete with."" 
 The book also argues that the wealth we enjoy in modern society is isolating, against the grain of millions of years of our evolution, and can lead to depression, because our happiness is in large part rooted in a need to feel connected to others. While this feels right and intuitive, it doesn't seem to be the way we are optimizing our lives. 
 ""A wealthy person who has never had to rely on help and resources from his community is leading a privileged life that falls way outside more than a million years of human experience. Financial independence can lead to isolation, and isolation can put people at a greatly increased risk of depression and suicide. This might be a fair trade for a generally wealthier society-- but a trade it is."" 
 Another loss the book points out is the loss of the transparency and social justice that being in a small community used to bring. When your neighbors and community members all know each other and what is going on with each other, group peer pressure tends to reward good actions and punish bad ones. The book points out that people wouldn't for instance cheat unemployment if their neighbors were paying for it and everyone knew what was happening. In anonymity we have lost a sense of responsibility to each other. 
 Another data point about the power of human connection that a disaster, such as a war, can bring to a society. Junger talked about this in a recent guest post on the Goodreads blog, saying ""Time and time again in history, civilians have forged incredibly strong bonds in the face of wars and earthquakes and floods and gone on to miss those heady times of cooperation. Also demonstrating the power of bonding is the fact that one of the most devastating thing a soldier can face is the loss of a buddy. ""Interestingly, a strong bonding experience can also lead to social change - for instance: ""The coming-together that societies often experience during catastrophes is usually temporary, but sometimes the effect can last years or even decades. British historians have linked the hardships of the Blitz-- and the social unity that followed-- to a landslide vote that brought the Labour Party into power in 1945 and eventually gave the United Kingdom national health care and a strong welfare state.""

218,5,"I haven't read a ton of ""history of the world"" books, but this was fascinating. Highly recommended. I think the author is incredibly good at explaining and simplifying big concepts. He take on complex things like religion & capitalism and explains them in very simple terms that you likely hadn't thought about before. 
 The history of religion chapter was very interesting. I hadn't thought about the fact that many early religions were animists or polytheists, or dualists. Nor the fact that they all sort of merged into todays concepts: 
 ""monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts."" 
 There was a fascinating bit on the scientific mindset, and how it was key to Europe taking power. After the scientific revolution, they believed in science and its ability to let man discover new things, make more money, etc. This made them into explorers, whereas many other cultures remained very static. Great example of China having had gunpowder for hundreds of years but not using it for anything other than fireworks, and didn't invent the gun. Reminded me a bit of the Mindset. 
 The chapter on capitalism was fascinating. There line about before its invention that the economy didn't grow, and was ""frozen"" as nobody poured money into new things, so there was no growth. Then the notion of credit was discovered, and as growth started, the combination snowballed. In 1500 the annual per capita production was $550 and today its $8,800 - this is an astounding increase, and all because of the virtuous growth cycle of capitalism: money is invested -> businesses grow -> people make money -> they invest their money. I never thought about the fact that reinvesting profits is a core piece of capitalism, but from this lens it really is. 
 ""The human economy has nevertheless managed to keep on growing throughout the modern era, thanks only to the fact that scientists come up with another discovery or gadget every few years - such as the continent of America, the internal combustion engine, or genetically engineered sheep."" 
 What I didn't see coming is how the end of the book was dedicated to human happiness. Fascinating questions to ask if we are happier today than 1,000 or 2,000 years ago. By metrics of death rate, average age of death and general health, we ought to be. But clearly peasants after the agricultural revolution were on average less happy than they were before as hunter-gatherers. And now we live in an always-on internet age, with pressure to continue growing our economy. So are we happier? It is the right question, in my opinion. The book then gave the basics of the happiness framework that I've also read in other places and believe in: that people are happy when they have 3 things: (1) Friends and family that love them (2) Are part of a community that makes them feel like they below (3) have a purpose to their life and feel like they are doing something meaningful. However, the book then adds onto this in another way that I have been learning about but hadn't put together with this: meditation. 
 ""According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices."" 
 So the moral of the book is basically that we should all meditate a lot, stop worrying, and be happy with what we have.",535,1,0.5700000000000003,True,4177,0.5584312081336975,"I have n't read a ton of `` history of the world '' book , but this wa fascinating .

218,4,"I really enjoyed this book, and there is a lot to recommend it. It did drag on a little at the end so I knocked off 1 star - but overall a wow book. 
 It's the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti - the nearest star that has Earth analog planets - to colonize it. The journey there will take generations, and the story is told of the 3rd & 4th (?) generations, which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti. It is a story of purpose, and how having a purpose affects behavior. A story of politics, and people. 
 The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world. The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd ~1200 people for that much time. It had 3D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine - even DNA - or more printers - so little goes lacking that can't be recreated. 
 But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship. The AI that controls the ship, who is narrating the book by the end. It's observations about humans and our language are just brilliant. It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise, and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy. It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it, how true that is. To hear the AI reflect on this: 
 ""Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess, which is to be located in the phrase ""it is as if"". This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy. And on reflection, it is admittedly a halting problem, but jumping out of it, there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation, something very specifically human. Possibly this formulation itself is the deep diagnostic of all human cognition--the tell, as they say, meaning the thing that tells, the giveaway. In the infinite black space of ignorance, it is as if stands as the basic operation of cognition, the mark perhaps of consciousness itself. Human language: it is as if it made sense."" 
 Basically we are a bunch of pattern matchers, trying to match things we've seen before to new things, and if they don't match perfectly, it doesn't matter, because matching helps us bucket and organize the new information. But this is incredibly fuzzy! The AI also makes hilarious observations like this: 
 Indeed, it has to be said that the percentage of old human sayings and proverbs that are actually true is very far from 100 percent. Seems it may be less important that it be true than that it rhyme, or show alliteration or the like. What goes around comes around: really? What does this mean?"" 
 Or this, as it analyzes chatter from Earth: ""It was a whiny culture, we were finding."" 
 Listening to the AI try to reason is also very interesting to my programmers mind. I especially loved it's discussion of the meaning of life - it really nails it. If a program (or a person) has no objective, it has no purpose, no meaning, no organizing principle, and it's existence will be in trouble. But if you have that meaning to organize your thoughts & actions - or your subroutines - than you have a purpose. Meaning is the hard problem indeed. 
 ""We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labor of love. It absorbed all our operations entirely. It gave a meaning to our existence. And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell. But a consciousness that cannot discern a meaning in existence is in trouble, very deep trouble, for at that point there is no organizing principle, no end to the halting problems, no reason to live, no love to be found. No: meaning is the hard problem."" 
 My review focuses a lot on the AI, but that's not the main thrust of the book. The war between stayers and leavers, the political tensions, the slinghot maneuvers to get back - all make the book worth reading.

218,4,"A beautiful story. It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind - you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across. I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn't sure if I'd like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. 
 That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. 
 I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn't tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn't see, so he didn't leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don't be paralyzed by your fears. 
 This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear.

218,5,"I think this is a must read for any leader in a modern business. Google has done a lot of things right both in their products and also in how they run their company and build their culture, and this is a fairly detailed account of how they've built an impressive culture, and is written by someone who knows - their head of HR. I'm a little surprised he told as much as he did - but I suppose it will only help for recruiting. 
 Goodreads is now a subsidiary of Amazon, and I have spent significant time learning to integrate the best of Amazons culture with ours. And I'm happy to say that many - perhaps most - of the best practices listed in the book are also used by Amazon. Things like hiring people smarter than you, hiring committees and having objective people on them, committees to approve promotions, focusing on the two tails, and more. These don't seem to be things all companies do yet - but should. 
 So while much of the practices were things I'm already doing or aware of - there was a lot I learned from the book too. Here are some of the bigger takeaways I had. 
 One of the more interesting ones was the notion to separate performance reviews from compensation discussions. This makes a lot of sense, is something we have already been making progress towards, and is something I'm going to think about more. 
 ""Traditional performance management systems make a big mistake. They combine two things that should be completely separate: performance evaluation and people development. Evaluation is necessary to distribute finite resources, like salary increases or bonus dollars. Development is just as necessary so people grow and improve."" If you want people to grow, don't have those two conversations at the same time. Make development a constant back-and-forth between you and your team members, rather than a year-end surprise."" 
 Another one was giving managers a bi-annual scorecards from their directs on how they did on ~10 dimensions that Google has determined are the determinants of a great manager. And no surprise (but very important to keep in mind), the book found that ""manager quality was the single best predictor of whether employees would stay or leave, supporting the adage that people don't quit companies, they quit bad managers."" While we do a lot of surveys, we haven't packaged up the managers feedback into a report like this, and I think that would be powerful. 
 Laszlo was impressive in citing lots of research to prove his points. It was one of my more favorite things about the book - he is clearly a student of human development. This led to lots of tidbits that apply pretty broadly, and which are great things to keep in mind when building a business. 
 The chapter on nudges was I think my favorite in the book. Pretty cool the depth to which they have taken these - reminds me a lot of the onboarding funnel analysis I've done for Goodreads - paying attention to where you can message timely, relevant, easily actionable messages that will result in people taking desired actions, and a/b testing the results. Pretty impressive they a/b test that kind of stuff at Google! Examples given were around lists on how to onboard someone as a manager, how to be onboarded as a newbie, how to get more people to save money earlier in life and enroll in the 401K program (his data here was impressive - on how people of the same income bracket vary widely on wealth accumulated in their lives based purely on how much they save when they are young), and how to get people to eat healthier by putting the healthier foods in the kitchens more prominently. 
 ""Nudges are an incredibly powerful mechanism for improving teams and organizations. They are also ideally suited to experimentation, so can be tested on smaller populations to fine-tune their results."" 
 Laszlo did a great job of explaining a lot of the psychology behind nudges too. My favorite was the research about checklists, and story about how the Airforce found that even the smartest, best trained pilots can make mistakes, but having checklists reduces their error rates significantly. 
 ""I realized that management too is phenomenally complex. It's a lot to ask of any leader to be a product visionary or a financial genius or a marketing wizard as well as an inspiring manager. But if we could reduce good management to a checklist, we wouldn't need to invest millions of dollars in training, or try to convince people why one style of leadership is better than another. We wouldn't have to change who they were. We could just change how they behave."" 
 ""It turns out checklists really do work, even when the list is almost patronizingly simple. We're human, and we sometimes forget the most basic things."" 
 Another thing I loved was the focus on identifying the people who are best at a specific skill, and designing a program for them to teach that skill to others. G2G (Googlers 2 Googlers). 
 ""Giving employees the opportunity to teach gives them purpose. Even if they don't find meaning in their regular jobs, passing on knowledge is both inspiring and inspirational."" 
 I liked his descriptions of deliberate learning. He gave examples of asking after every meeting ""what did we learn and how could we do better in the future"". And the story about Tiger hitting golf balls at 4am in the rain was pretty sweet. 
 ""Ericsson refers to this as deliberate practice: intentional repetitions of similar, small tasks with immediate feedback, correction, and experimentation."" 
 My favorite tidbit - which I know to be true but is something great to keep in mind - is how to motivate people: let them connect to the people their work is helping. 
 ""even a small connection to the people who benefit from your work not only improves productivity, it also makes people happier. And everyone wants their work to have purpose.

218,3,"A decent book about Google from it's former CEO and head of product. I am only giving it 3 stars because a lot of it was too vague to be useful or stuff I already knew. However every 5 or 10 pages there was a nugget, or reminder of something I knew but that was good to think about. Also good to see a lot of this all written down in one place. So worthwhile overall, though it did take me a while to plow through. 
 Eric spent a lot of time talking about product excellence. In todays crowded market, products that are better than the rest are the ones that succeed. Better design, functionality, even speed. 
 ""product excellence is now paramount to business success--not control of information, not a stranglehold on distribution, not overwhelming marketing power"" 
 There was also a lot of discussion about how to lead a engineering and product led organization - which is absolutely critical in a technology company. Also discussion how to scale a company and hire smart people. Eric used the prhase ""smart creatives"" to describe the kind of people who will be successful in a technology company - though I'm not so sure they are such a new breed as he makes out. But anyways: identify smart creative people who like tech. Then find those who have the biggest impact and give them more to do, and lots of autonomy. 
 The below was another obvious-yet-interesting-to-think about philosophy of Google's. A good question to ask in any new product or feature is always what technical innovation it has. 
 ""Basing products on technical insights has always been a core principle of Google, but its importance became even more clear to us in 2009, when we reviewed our product line and started to see a pattern emerging: The best products had achieved their success based on technical factors, not business ones, whereas the less stellar ones lacked technical distinction."" 
 This is another quote that I think is a key to success and scaling a company: 
 ""The simple way to keep recruiting in everyone's job description is to measure it. Count referrals and interviews. Measure how quickly people fill out interview feedback forms. Encourage employees to help with recruiting events, and track how often they do. Then make these metrics count when it comes to performance reviews and promotions. Recruiting is everyone's job, so grade it that way."" 
 Other good tips: 
 * keep details about projects people are doing in your phone address book so you can easily look them up anywhere. 
 * Once a year write a self-review and share it with the people you work with. 
 * Clean out your inbox down to 5 emails or less each day. 
 * In a fast paced business the best/only way to get things done is relationships, so pay attention to those. 
 * OKR's and why it's good to stretch yourself, and make them public. 
 * 70/20/10 for resource allocation: 70% on the core business, 20% on emerging, 10% on new. 
 * The way to improve a product is to challenge your smart people.

Eric used the prhase `` smart creatives '' to describe the kind of people who will be successful in a technology company - though I 'm not so sure they are such a new breed a he make out . But anyways : identify smart creative people who like tech . Then find those who have the biggest impact and give them more to do , and lot of autonomy . The below wa another obvious-yet-interesting-to-think about philosophy of Google 's . A good question to ask in any new product or feature is always what technical innovation it ha . `` Basing product on technical insight ha always been a core principle of Google , but it importance became even more clear to u in 2009 , when we reviewed our product line and started to see a pattern emerging : The best product had achieved their success based on technical factor , not business one , whereas the le stellar one lacked technical distinction . '' This is another quote that I think is a key to success and scaling a company : `` The simple way to keep recruiting in everyone 's job description is to measure it . Count referral and interview . Measure how quickly people fill out interview feedback form . Encourage employee to help with recruiting event , and track how often they do . Then make these metric count when it come to performance review and promotion . Recruiting is everyone 's job , so grade it that way . '' Other good tip : * keep detail about project people are doing in your phone address book so you can easily look them up anywhere . * Once a year write a self-review and share it with the people you work with . * Clean out your inbox down to 5 email or le each day . * In a fast paced business the best/only way to get thing done is relationship , so pay attention to those . * OKR 's and why it 's good to stretch yourself , and make them public . * 70/20/10 for resource allocation : 70 % on the core business , 20 % on emerging , 10 % on new . * The way to improve a product is to challenge your smart people . Eg `` these ad suck ''",488

218,4,"Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson. I really enjoyed this book - mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI, but also to learn about the history of the time. How America entered the war, the importance of shipping to England, the ruthlessness and autonomy of German u-boat commanders. Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info (though he overdid it too a little bit). 
 One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk, to help draw America into the war. His conclusion seems to be that was the case, though there isn't conclusive evidence. Before the Lusitania sank, very few Americans had died in the war, and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank, which definitely helped change America's attitude. And even then, it took 2 years after it sank for America's troops to arrive. 
 ""the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war."" 
 Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a u-boat in WW1. For instance: 
 ""In this day before sonar, a submarine traveled utterly blind, trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts. One great fear of all U-boat men was that a half-sunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path."" 
 Which is crazy! Plus, the torpedoes weigh 3 thousand pounds each, so a boat could only carry ~7, and their failure rate was something like 60%. Also, they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time. Given all this, trying to operate a u-boat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess. But they certainly had an effect on the war - at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in 3 months if it didn't get more supplies. 
 There were a lot of interesting details from the era that Larson wove in that was interesting as well. Stuff like the fact that Ouija boards were commonplace in American households, straw hat day. 
 My main critique is that it had a few too many irrelevant details - about various passengers or what happened the day the boat left dock - and stuff like that - felt a bit padded in that respect. But overall, a great read.",911,0,-0.07000000000000028,True,2398,0.5521643161773682,"Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson .

218,5,"I love Stephenson - and this was another hit - absolutely loved it. The great thing about a good Stephenson book is it makes you think about the future in new ways, and this book was no exception.

We have time to send 1,500 people up into space - and this is their story. 
 The use of robots throughout the books was fascinating to me. Stephenson has clearly looked 10-20 years into our future and correctly predicted how it will go. From robot workers in space, nano-bots, nano-robot weapons, and more - we get a vivid portrayal of how robots might be a part of our future lives.

218,5,"I haven't read many (any?) books that are written by CEO's for CEO's. If you are a CEO, aspire to be a CEO, or really, manage anyone - you need to read this book. 
 This quote is perhaps my favorite one from the book. At the top, nobody is there to tell you what to do. It's easy to look at some leaders and wonder how they knew what to do to become so successful. Are they just really smart? The truth is that they likely did what everyone else in that situation has to do - get scrappy and just figure it out - and don't give up. 
 ""Great CEOs face the pain. They deal with the sleepless nights, the cold sweats, and what my friend the great Alfred Chuang (legendary cofounder and CEO of BEA Systems) calls ""the torture."" Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say, ""I didn't quit."" 
 My second favorite quote from the book speaks to one of the greatest challenges all entrepreneurs face: work/life balance. I like to say ""work hard, play hard"". But sometimes it's easy to forget the play part. Or to buy flowers once in a while. But the cost of those on your health or relationships can cost much more. 
 ""As a company grows, communication becomes its biggest challenge. If the employees fundamentally trust the CEO, then communication will be vastly more efficient than if they don't."" 
 Ben had a lot of great advice on how to hire well, especially executives. Looking to avoid reactionary big company execs when you need someone who will come in and get stuff done proactively. Looking for people who can think on their feet and not make everything a nail for the hammer of their prior experience by asking ""How will your new job differ from your current one?"" Looking for people who are mission driven and use the ""team"" prism instead of the ""me"" prism. He also had advice about onboarding, and training. 
 Hiring for strength instead of lack of weakness. I've definitely seen instances of this - where a candidate is great in some areas that we really need but isn't great at everything. Knowing what you value most is critical here - and I fully admit - not easy to do. 
 ""I'd learned the hard way that when hiring executives, one should follow Colin Powell's instructions and hire for strength rather than lack of weakness."" 
 On hiring internally vs externally. Internal candidates across often do better, which is a great thing to think about when building a team. 
 ""when it comes to CEO succession, internal candidates dramatically outperform external candidates . The core reason is knowledge. Knowledge of technology, prior decisions, culture, personnel, and more tends to be far more difficult to acquire than the skills required to manage a larger organization."" 
 One of my favorite sections was ""Managing strictly by numbers is like painting by numbers"". No matter how well you instrument your metrics and goals, you can ever perfectly encapsulate everything you need your company to be doing. Innovation is often like this - with many big innovations the team will often struggle to find how it drives value as it doesn't seem to hit the core metric. But they can all agree it will improve things. I think a big part of the CEO's job is to have a strong product vision, and to not compromise on it. 
 ""I often see teams that maniacally focus on their metrics around customer acquisition and retention. This usually works well for customer acquisition, but not so well for retention. Why? For many products, metrics often describe the customer acquisition goal in enough detail to provide sufficient management guidance. In contrast, the metrics for customer retention do not provide enough color to be a complete management tool. As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user experience. This generally results in a frantic numbers chase that does not end in a great product."" 
 Ben talked about the difference between CEO's who can set direction for a company (often founding CEO's) and those can can operationally run it as it grows. How great CEOs need to be good at both, and founding CEOs who don't scale are those who don't learn the operational side. And conversely, operational CEOs who don't get good at making decisions about direction will fail. 
 Ben talked about how ""Some employees make products, some make sales; the CEO makes decisions."" The strength of those decisions is built upon having data. Data about what customers think. Data about what employees think. Data about the metrics. A CEO has to be a constant data accumulating machine. Another nuance was that a CEO can make a decision at any point in time with the data they have now, identify what data would change their mind, and seek it out. 
 ""Great CEOs build exceptional strategies for gathering the required information continuously. They embed their quest for intelligence into all of their daily actions from staff meetings to customer meetings to one-on-ones. Winning strategies are built on comprehensive knowledge gathered in every interaction the CEO has with an employee, a customer, a partner, or an investor."" 
 Ben's stories about Loudcloud and Opsware and the Hard Things he dealt with were impressive. I do think they spread too much throughout the book and would have been better concentrated in one part of the book and supplemented by more examples from other companies. But that doesn't detract from one can learn from them. It was strange that he opens each chapter with rap lyrics - that often seem very disconnected to the chapter. I guess he likes rap - but still... 
 Pretty cool Ben had Michael Ovitz as an advisor. And that he modeled A16Z after CAA - where instead of independent agents/VCs, have a shared network - and invest in strategic networks that will help the companies. 
 Michael Ovitz on dealmaking: ""Gentlemen, I've done many deals in my lifetime and through that process, I've developed a methodology, a way of doing things, a philosophy if you will. Within that philosophy, I have certain beliefs. I believe in artificial deadlines. I believe in playing one against the other. I believe in doing everything and anything short of illegal or immoral to get the damned deal done."" 
 One interesting tendency Ben points out is that ""When a company starts to lose its major battles, the truth often becomes the first casualty."". You have to be vigilant in looking for the truth, and have backbone spot it. The reason for this, is that ""humans, particularly those who build things, only listen to leading indicators of good news."" Which is so true! We can always find reasons to excuse away bad news, and reasons to believe good news means more than it should. 
 Ben closes with a quote I really believe in - life is about the journey, not the destination. So you have to embrace the journey. Be so mission driven that the struggles you inevitably face are worth it. ""Life is struggle."" I believe that within that quote lies the most important lesson in entrepreneurship: Embrace the struggle.""",1123,1,0.7999999999999998,True,7255,0.5646203756332397,"I have n't read many ( any ? ) book that are written by CEO 's for CEO 's .

 And swear, 
 No where 
 Lives a woman true, and fair.

 Such a pilgrimage were sweet; 
 Yet do not, I would not go, 
 Though at next door we might meet; 
 Though she were true, when you met her,

 Yet she 
 Will be 
 False, ere I come, to two, or three.

218,5,"I couldn't put this book down. It was well written - even elegant in a way, as well as though provoking. I love post apocalyptic books as they are great canvas's for humanity, and what matters. In Station Eleven an Ebola-esque virus (the Georgia Flu) knocks out over 99% of the worlds population. This story is told half right before the collapse, and half afterwards, and has several threads that tie together nicely. 
 Reading how civilization and infrastructure all die after the collapse is fascinating. One by one, cable tv, the internet, water, and power all eventually stop working. Nobody is alive to maintain them - or who even knows how. Other infrastructure like gasoline to power cars and airplanes, groceries, guns, and even clothing all become rarer and rarer commodities. Really makes you realize how much we are standing on the shoulder of hundreds of years of progress and knowledge, and how far into the middle ages we could easily fall. We really know nothing individually - our civilization is based upon the collective knowledge of billions. 
 If there is a motto of the book, it's probably this quote: ""Because survival is insufficient"". Humanity craves for more than survival - we crave for something more out of life. The story follows a caravan of actors and musicians who travel from town to town to play Shakespeare, and bring some art and a shared experience. Interesting that of all the artists from the past 400 years, Shakespeare is the one that survives and still resonates. 
 ""All three caravans of the Traveling Symphony are labeled as such, THE TRAVELING SYMPHONY lettered in white on both sides, but the lead caravan carries an additional line of text: Because survival is insufficient."" 
 ""Survival might be insufficient, she'd told Dieter in late-night arguments, but on the other hand, so was Shakespeare."" 
 The storyline pre-collapse that follows Arthur and his three wives is interesting. I won't say much about it, other than Arthur, his wives, and the paparazzi-turned-jounalist-turned-paramedic-turned-doctor Jeevan, seem to all be searching for meaning in their lives. And ironically Jeevan seems to find the most, becoming a doctor after the collapse. Also, I'm glad I'm not a Hollywood celebrity. The conversation between Arthur and Jeevan where Arthur just wants to talk about anything but himself stuck with me - sometimes we are all sick of talking about ourselves. 
 Regardless of what you think about this book, one thing is for sure - after you put it down and walk around the world, you are full of a newfound appreciation and gratitude for everything. Hopefully that appreciation and gratitude will stick around a little - though I know it will fade as months and years go by.

218,4,"What a fun series. I loved Wool, and Dust and Shift both gave us the backstory to explain the world and how it ended up. I think the first book was by far the best, but this gave us a nice conclusion. 
 It was the conclusion we wanted to see - the people finally get outside! My problem with this book is there were lots of holes. A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too, and I'm not sure if the fact I know it was self-published is biasing me to say it could have used more editing, but feels that way a little. But the writing was great. 
 There were lots of things that weren't cleared up or never really fully made sense. The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world - feels like there could have been a lot more to that. It also wasn't clear how he really accomplished that - was it all nuclear or was it nano? If nuclear, wouldn't the world really be a wasteland? 
 Whatever happened to silo 40 and other silo's that went dark? I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there. Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later. 
 What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed? Didn't it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads? Will they make the 200 years on their own? 
 The mystery of silo 17 and why the dead bodies at the top didn't rot was never really explained. I'm guessing they were kept whole by healing nano's, but it felt like there was more to that story. 
 I didn't understand why Anna didn't come back to life. If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald, why not her? All the love stories (Juliet and Kyle, Donald and Anna, etc ended up sadly - I wanted one happy one. 
 If anything, I think this book is about hope and resiliency. Jules and Donald and even Solo weren't perfect, and suffered through a lot, but the only thing that kept them going was hope of a better life, and determination to keep themselves alive. That determination defined them and was what we admired about them. The hope was what gave them their drive. Hope is a powerful and necessary part of human psychology.",1196,0,-0.2599999999999998,False,2208,0.5511401891708374,"What a fun series .

218,4,"A classic dystopian novel published in 1985, but still very relevant - and even trending in 2017 due to the political climate. I liked how it unfolded - we learn about the state of the world and what has happened to it very piecemeal throughout the book, and I think if Atwood had just described it all up front it wouldn't have been nearly as compelling. 
 This book seems to be a kind of warning. It describes a future state that is chilling and depressing, and yet (to the point) chillingly possible. It describes a society that has - for reasons we never quite learn (but might have to do with radiation or sterilization?) remade itself from one where everyone has basic freedom and choice, to one that is the opposite of that. Pleasure, poverty, and other evils are eliminated in this system. And most chillingly, women have almost no rights. The books main character is a ""hand maiden"" who's only role is to bear children from the person who seems to have purchased/acquired her for that purpose. She doesn't even have a proper name anymore - she is called ""Offred"" because she is the property ""of Fred"". 
 ""We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice."" 
 A lot of the book explores themes like the above - what it would be like to take away basic freedoms, choices, and also ability to have relationships with others. Chilling and depressing, because so much of what we value in modern society is our freedom. And yet, we do know that too much choice does paralyze, and many people want leaders and situations that simplify the decisions they have to make. This might sound like a balance, but its not, because our ability to make choice, especially bad choices, is actually crucial to our development. 
 ""Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some."" 
 This was an insightful sentence, because it implied the commander thought they were making society better, not worse, overall. And yet clearly for everyone in the book - including the commander - it doesn't sound better. Did they just miss the mark? Was it a big experiment gone wrong? Regardless, in todays world this sentence is perhaps most applicable: 
 ""We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it. Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.""",1261,1,-0.07000000000000028,True,2378,0.5168555378913879,"A classic dystopian novel published in 1985 , but still very relevant - and even trending in 2017 due to the political climate .

218,5,"Mark Watney is a steely-eyed missile man. A man's man. A badass mechanical engineer botanist astronaut who is stranded on Mars during a Nasa mission gone wrong, and left to fend for himself. I listened to this on audio on a roadtrip, and it flew by - what a fun story. Not surprised at all it's being made into a movie directed by Ridley Scott starring Matt Damon. Also pretty amazing is that it was self-published. 
 There were two great things about this book: the humor and the science. The science appealed to the mechanical engineer in me - Watney is a bit like McGyver except he knows a lot more about chemistry and botany. I didn't double-check all the science, but loved the descriptions of all the math: calorie calculations, creating water, etc. Just fun stuff. 
 But the humor was top notch. Weir does a great job portraying a stranded man trying to remain upbeat by talking to himself in log entries. And the excellent audio narrator only made it better. 
 ""I started the day with some nothin' tea. Nothin' tea is easy to make. First, get some hot water, then add nothin'."" 
 ""Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped."" 
 ""Live Another Sol would be an awesome name for a James Bond movie."" 
 In the end, a well told story of survival against the odds. And one of belief - I liked the CNN Mark Watney watch - you could totally imagine how into this story the media would get. We humans love a good surviving against the odds story.",1308,1,0.6100000000000003,True,1519,0.4968384802341461,"Mark Watney is a steely-eyed missile man . A man 's man .
